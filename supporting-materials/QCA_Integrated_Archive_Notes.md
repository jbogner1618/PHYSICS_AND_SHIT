## ðŸ“– Abstract

This document presents a comprehensive, falsification-oriented, integrated theoretical and experimental framework exploring the Consciousness-Field Hypothesis (CFH). It formalizes the introduction of a hypothetical scalar field Î¨, coupling to both neural coherence and electromagnetic energy density under distinct yet mathematically unified Lagrangian models. The hypothesis proposes this Î¨-field modulates microphysical correlations and mesoscopic force effects, measurable via modified CHSH Bell tests and Biefeld-Brown-like capacitors respectively. This archive integrates rigorous theoretical derivations, dimensional analyses, renormalizability status, finite element simulation plans, and experimental protocols. A clear roadmap for critical disproof or verification is defined. All parameters, propagators, and coupling forms are explicitly stated and dimensionally validated. Remaining theoretical limitations and assumptions are disclosed with proposed next steps.
