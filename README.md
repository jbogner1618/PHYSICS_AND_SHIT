# Theoretical Physics Research: Coherence-Modulated Field Theory

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of **theoretical thought experiments** and computational models exploring novel approaches to fundamental physics. The work centers around the hypothesis that observer coherence may influence physical systems through modulation of underlying field structures. All material is presented as speculative theoretical research for academic consideration and discussion.

> **Academic Note**: This repository contains theoretical explorations and thought experiments. All proposed mechanisms and predictions should be understood as speculative theoretical constructs intended to stimulate academic discussion rather than established scientific fact.

## Academic Engagement Guidelines

### Theoretical Context
This work represents **speculative theoretical physics** intended to explore novel approaches to longstanding problems in foundational physics. All proposals should be understood as:

- Theoretical thought experiments rather than empirical claims
- Speculative frameworks for academic consideration
- Mathematical models requiring rigorous experimental validation
- Starting points for scholarly discussion and critique

### Experimental Considerations
Any experimental predictions made within this theoretical framework:
- Require careful design to distinguish proposed effects from known physics
- Need rigorous statistical analysis with appropriate controls
- Should be subjected to standard peer review processes
- Must account for potential systematic errors and alternative explanations

### Professional Safety
Academics engaging with this material are encouraged to:
- Treat all proposals as theoretical speculation requiring validation
- Frame discussions in terms of "interesting theoretical questions"
- Maintain appropriate scholarly skepticism and critical analysis
- Present any related research within established academic protocols

## Technical Requirements

### Simulations
- Python 3.9+
- Qiskit 2.x+ with qiskit-aer
- NumPy, Rich (for console output)

### Theory Documents  
- LaTeX with AMS mathematical packages
- Standard physics notation and conventions

## File Index

A comprehensive file index with detailed descriptions is maintained in `FILE_INDEX.md`.
